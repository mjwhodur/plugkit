  This ensures your contribution follows the project's conventions.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Contributions

You may use AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) **to assist with
documentation, comments, or writing Pull Request descriptions**, as long as:

- You have reviewed and fully understand the generated content,
- The content does not include any third-party material without proper
  permission or licensing,
- You add a short note in your PR if AI was used.

We **do not accept source code generated entirely or partially by AI** unless it
was reviewed, understood, and modified by a human contributor.  
This project values transparency, understanding, and responsible use of modern
tools.
